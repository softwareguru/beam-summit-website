In this talk, we'll share how we use Apache Beam at Schrodinger to power key stages of the drug discovery pipeline, from R-group enumeration in lead optimization to crystal structure determination in drug formulation. Rather than relying on existing runners, we built our own execution engine on top of Beamâ€™s powerful abstraction layer to better serve our domain-specific needs.
