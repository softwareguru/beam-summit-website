Credit Karma leverages Apache Beam to address a broad spectrum of data processing requirements, particularly real-time data transformation to bolster machine learning models. Key applications include:
1. preprocessing data and constructing graphs for live model scoring,
2. large-scale ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) operations for analytics, and
3. real-time aggregation of features to furnish near-instantaneous insights to models
