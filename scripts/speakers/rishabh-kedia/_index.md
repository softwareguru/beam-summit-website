As a Backend Software Engineer, I specialize in designing and developing distributed systems for large-scale data processing. My focus lies in technologies such as Apache Flink, Apache Beam, Kafka, Cloud Computing, and Google Dataflow. 
 
 
 
 My expertise in these technologies enables me to build real-time data processing systems that can handle large volumes of data with high efficiency and reliability. I work closely with other engineers and stakeholders to identify requirements and implement scalable and secure solutions.
