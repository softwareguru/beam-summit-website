Lorenzo has multiple years of experience working in Integration and Big Data projects. Working at Google since 2010, he supported technical integration on several Google products. He is a Certified Google Cloud Architect, Data Engineer, YouTube Audience Growth, and Digital Rights.
 
 In his spare time, Lorenzo loves investigating areas where technology can help increase the autonomy of people with disabilities. This passion led Lorenzo to start a 20% project inside Google focused on making the Google Assistant more accessible, announced at Google I/O 2019: Project DIVA. Project DIVA inspired Action Blocks, a Google application released in 2020.
