On July 8–9, the Apache Beam community came together in New York City for an unforgettable edition of **Beam Summit 2025.** This year’s summit was hosted at Google’s **St. John’s Terminal**, where we welcomed the Apache Beam Community, data engineers, researchers, developers, and open-source advocates from around the world, all gathered to explore what’s next in the world of data processing.

Some of the highlights included:
