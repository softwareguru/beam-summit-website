Welcome to the Beam Digital Summit 2021 "Call for Papers". The goal of the summit is to grow the community, exchange ideas and knowledge around "Apache Beam".
We are looking for speakers that can provide technical insights, but also for people that can tell interesting stories on how and where "Apache Beam" is used.
The following session types are suggested (if you have a good reason to deviate from the format please add this to your description):
Session 20m: A short session of 20 minutes, ideal for a use-case or technical insight.
Session 40m: A long session of 40 minutes, ideal for a technical deep dive.
Workshops of half an hour, 1 or 2 hours on a specific topic.
Lightning talks of maximum 7 minutes..
