### The deadline for the Beam Summit 2025 CFP has been extended to April 30th

### Welcome to the Beam Summit 2025 "Call for Papers".

We are looking for speakers that can provide technical insights, but also for people that can tell interesting stories on how and where "Apache Beam" is used.

### Theme/topics for this year

The overall theme for focus for this edition of Beam Summit is "Bridging the Data Streams" which is about how Apache Beam empowers users to seamlessly integrate and process data from disparate sources, including real-time streams, batch repositories, and emerging data platforms.

### Some of the focus areas are:

* **Unified Data Processing with ML Integration:** Leveraging Beam's unified model to simplify the development of both batch and stream processing pipelines, and exploring how to embed ML models directly in those pipelines for real-time insights.

* **Connecting Disparate Systems with Modern Data Lakehouses:** Showcasing practical examples of integrating Beam with various data sources like databases, cloud storage, Kafka message queues, APIs, Apache Iceberg for efficient and reliable data lake management.

* **Real-time ML-Driven Data Insights:** Exploring the use of Beam, alongside Kafka, for building low-latency, real-time data applications, such as fraud detection, anomaly detection, personalized recommendations, with real time ML inferencing.

* **Scalability and Performance with Optimized Storage:** Addressing the challenges of scaling Beam pipelines to handle massive datasets and high-velocity streams, with a focus on how Iceberg facilitates optimized data storage and retrieval.

* **Ecosystem and Community with Modern Data Tools:** Highlighting the vibrant Beam ecosystem, including contributions from various organizations and the active community driving its development, with focus on tools like Kafka and Iceberg.

* **Emerging Trends (AI/ML and Lakehouse Architectures):** Discussing the future of data processing and how Beam is evolving to meet the demands of new technologies, such as advanced AI/ML integration, serverless computing, and the growing importance of data lakehouse architectures using technologies like Iceberg.


We are particularly interested in how you are integrating Beam with other tools like Kafka, Iceberg, Airflow and any others you are using.

### Session duration

The following session types are suggested (if you have a good reason to deviate from the format please add this to your description):

* Session 25m: Live session of 25 minutes, ideal for a use-case.
* Session 50m: Live session of 50 minutes, ideal for a technical deep dive.
* Workshop (120 minutes). Live, hands-on workshops.

We're focusing on admitting speakers who can attend in-person to the event in New York City. Unfortunately, we are unable to support travel or lodging fees for speakers.

The deadline for submissions was extended to April 30th and we will be confirming speakers on May 9th. We had an early round of review and selections during the week of March 22nd for those speakers who needed an early decision (for example because they needed to request a visa for the USA).

Reach out for any questions regarding this process.  Unfortunately, we are unable to support travel or lodging fees for speakers at this time but are happy to make recommendations for planning purposes to this free event!
