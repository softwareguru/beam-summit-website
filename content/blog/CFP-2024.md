The "Call for Papers" for Beam Summit 2024 is open. 

We are looking for speakers that can provide technical insights, but also for people that can tell interesting stories on how and where "Apache Beam" is used.

The following session types are suggested (if you have a good reason to deviate from the format please add this to your description):

* Session 25m: Live session of 25 minutes, ideal for a use-case.
* Session 50m: Live session of 50 minutes, ideal for a technical deep dive.
* Workshop (3 hours). Live, half-day, onsite only workshops.
* Lightning talk 10m: Quick talks that are ideal for sharing insight or drawing attention to a specific topic. These may be prerecorded.
