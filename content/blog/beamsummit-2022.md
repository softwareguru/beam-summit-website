Hello there!

Just a quick message to let you know that we are currently planning Beam Summit 2022.

After a couple of years of Beam Summit being an online-only event, we are hoping we can meet physically for 2022. We are currently looking at options for cities/venues/dates. Most likely it will be in mid July in the USA.

All talks will also be streamed online, so if it is not possible for you to join us in person, you will still be able to watch all talks live.

Please watch this site and the Apache Beam communication channels (mailing list, slack) for updates. 

Happy holidays!
