Kerry Donny-Clark is a manager of the Apache Beam team at Google. Before this he has been a professional yo-yo player, an English teacher in Japan, a cancer researcher, an elven fighter/mage, a janitor, a circus performer, and various kinds of software engineer. Kerry likes to build things, from furniture to applications, and his hobby is collecting other hobbies. He lives in the woods of Pittsboro NC with his wife, six kids, 2 cats, and a dog named Krypto.

Kerry will teach us about why Google cares about Apache Beam, and also about how many internal teams at Google use Beam's Python and Go SDKs for ML workloads and log analytics.
