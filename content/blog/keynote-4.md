Wei Hsia who is a Developer Advocate at Google, alongside Israel Herraiz a Strategic Cloud Engineer at Google Cloud, and Sergei Lilichenko who works as a Solutions Architect at Google will teach this this three-hour workshop intended for Beam practitioners who wish to advance their knowledge of Apache Beam and Google Cloud Dataflow.
In this workshop, the attendees will be implementing a streaming pipeline in Python. The pipeline will feature the new cross language support in Beam and Dataflow. Cross language support allows access to other Beam transforms without having to introduce a new language into your environment.

The streaming pipeline will pick up Cloud Pub/Sub messages and deliver them to Google Cloud BigQuery in real time. The cross language transforms will allow the author to invoke Java transforms from within a Python pipeline.

The attendees will write their own pipelines with guidance from the workshop facilitators and have the opportunity to deploy it in Google Cloud using the Google Cloud Dataflow runner.
