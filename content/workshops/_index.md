We will be offering hands-on workshops on how to use Apache Beam in different scenarios and with different infrastructure. 

* Format & duration: We will have 1 hour and 2 hour workshops. You can expect the 2 hour workshops to go more in depth and allow time for participants to go through the labs, while the 1 hour workshops will have a quicker pace.
* Capacity: Capacity is limited to 60 participants per workshop. We will enable a wait list and see if it is necessary to open more groups. Please register for a workshop only if you are really committed to participating in it.
