## Will the event be onsite or online?
Virtual Beam Summit 2023 is an online event on July 18-20, 2023. It includes recordings of sessions presented at the in-person edition of Beam Summit (June 13-15 in NYC) plus new live sessions and workshops.

## What is the point of having a schedule for prerecorded sessions? Can't I just watch them on-demand?
The reason for having a schedule for presenting pre-recorded sessions is that the speakers will be connecting in order to address questions live. Once a session is broadcasted in the "programed" schedule, it will be available for on-demand viewing.

## Is the event free?
Yes! Beam Summit (both the in-person and online editions) is free.

## How can I enter the online event?
The online event is held on the Airmeet platform. Please [visit the event on Airmeet](https://us.airmeet.com/e/138ddb30-1125-11ee-9414-e3f48addae7e) and follow the instructions to register and access.
