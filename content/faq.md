## Will the event be onsite or online?
We are currently evaluating this. We would like an onsite component but in case we do this we will also live stream all talks for free.

## How can I interact with other participants?
We will be using slack to interact with speakers and other participants. Please join the #beam-summit-attendees channel in the ASF slack workspace. If you need to create an account, please [click here](https://s.apache.org/slack-invite) so that you can create an account without an invitation or ASF email.

## Will sessions be recorded?
All sessions will be recorded. They will be available in two stages with different qualities:
* A few minutes after each session is finished, recordings will be available for viewing directly in Crowdcast. In order to watch a recording of a previous session in Crowdcast, click on the SCHEDULE (upper left corner within the Crowdcast window) and select the session you want. The downside to this recorded version is that it may have "dead time" before the actual start of the talk, plus the audio may not have the best quality.
* At most one week after each talk is performed, we will upload an edited+cleaned version of the recording to the [Apache Beam YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UChNnb_YO_7B0HlW6FhAXZZQ).

### Is there a code of conduct?
Yes. You can review it [here](/coc).
