Scio is a Scala wrapper around Apache Beam, developed by Spotify, and neatly integrated with Google Cloud Platform. In this workshop, we will develop a streaming pipeline, showing how to get data in JSON format and map it to a case class, how to transform it and write it to BigQuery, automatically inferring the schema from a case class. And all this in a "scalactic" way!
