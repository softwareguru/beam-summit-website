I created a library for error handling with Apache Beam Java and Kotlin. Asgarde allows error handling with less code and more concise/expressive code. The purpose is showing Beam native error handling, and the same with Asgarde Java.



I will also show Asgarde Kotlin with even more concise code and a more functional style.

The example with Asgarde will store the bad sink in a Bigquery table (DLQ).



We used Asgarde in production code at my actual big customer  (L'Or√©al/ France).



It was very important for us to treat errors and not break our jobs in this case.
