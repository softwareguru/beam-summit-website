In this session, we will explore different windowing strategies, and the impact on dropping (or not) late data. We will use a unit test with a synthetic stream, and then we will apply different windows and will make a grouping calculation (aggregation) to check how different windows group data in different ways, and how the parameters of the windows affect how data is grouped in windows.
