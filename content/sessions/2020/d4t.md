Open source project Hop aims to make anything data orchestration related easier and recently added visual pipeline development for Apache Beam. This session goes over the architecture and the possibilities with live demos. Learn how easy it is to get those Beam pipelines up-and-running and find out how you can tune for performance in batch and streaming modes.
