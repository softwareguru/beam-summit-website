Legacy Dataflow templates allow you to stage your pipelines on Cloud Storage and run them from a variety of environments. This talk covers the new Flex Templates feature, in which staging and execution are separate steps. The separation provides additional flexibility to decide who can run jobs, where the jobs are run from, and job execution steps based on input and output parameters.
