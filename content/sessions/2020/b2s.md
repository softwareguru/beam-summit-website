What up with all the metadata on the metadata? This deep dive into BIP-1, Beam Improvement Proposal One, tells the story about Schema Options. Schema Options give extra context to row fields and schemas. I'll dive in the proposal and give a break down of the potential use, but I can already give some real-world examples of how we're using these options in our ingestion platform, based on Beam.
