Learn how Luma Pictures uses Apache Beam to automate the creation of visual effects on films like Marvel's Spider-Man: Far From Home. Pulling off effects at this scale requires hundreds of artists working across multiple time zones on sophisticated simulations of natural phenomenon and massive data sets. Beam reacts to events within our studio in real-time, acting as the conveyor belt between departments in our digital assembly-line.
