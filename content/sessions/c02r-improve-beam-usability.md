In this talk we will share existing user feedback that we've gathered from Apache Beam users.  

The rough structure of the lightning talk is:
 1. We take user feedback seriously
 2. What existing users like and dislike about Apache Beam
 3. What we're currently doing to make improvements
 4. How can the community help us build the best SDK ever
