In this workshop, Hannes guides the audience through the process of writing custom pipeline components for TensorFlow Extended with Apache Beam.

TensorFlow Extended (TFX) allows machine learning engineers to define machine learning pipelines for their production model training. Complex pipelines require the customization of pipeline components which benefit greatly from Apache Beam.

In this session, Hannes explains step-by-step how the audience can write custom TFX components with Apache Beam to customize your ML pipelines beyond the standard components and tailor the components for their ML pipelines.

Hannes is the co-author of the upcoming O'Reilly publication "Building Machine Learning Pipeline" which provides an introduction to Apache Beam for its readers. He is currently a senior data scientist at SAP Concur.
