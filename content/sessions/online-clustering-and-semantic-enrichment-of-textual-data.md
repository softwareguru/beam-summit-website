In this talk, we will be looking at some Apache Beam design patterns and best practices that you can use to successfully build your own Machine Learning workflows. We will be looking at examples of applying Apache Beam to solve real-world problems, such as real-time semantic enrichment and online clustering of text content. We will also discover how to use Beam efficiently as an orchestrator for Machine Learning services and how to design your entire system with scalability in mind.
