Apache Beamâ€™s concept can sometimes be overwhelming. Sometimes is hard to see why something is designed the way it is. One of these concepts is the Combine function. This session takes a non-trivial data structure (the OpenTelemetry Exponential Histogram) as an example and goes through each step in the design on making it a super-efficient Combine function. Learn by example.
