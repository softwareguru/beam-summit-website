In this workshop we'll give a detailed overview of the Apache Hop platform.  We'll design a few simple Beam pipelines using the Hop GUI after which we'll run them on a few runners like GCP DataFlow and Spark.  After that we'll cover best practices for version control, unit testing, integration testing and much more.

No prior knowledge of Apache Hop or Beam is required to follow this workshop.
