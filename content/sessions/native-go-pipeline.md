Over the past year, the Beam Go Sdk has rolled out several features to support native streaming DoFns. This talk will dig into those features and discuss how they can be used to build streaming pipelines written entirely in Go.



Attendees will come away with an understanding of some of the challenges associated with processing unbounded datasets. They will also learn how they can build their own custom streaming splittable DoFns to address those challenges.
