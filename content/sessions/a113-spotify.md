At Spotify we run more than 18,000 data pipelines. To help our developers build and maintain those, we made Scio - a Scala API for Beam, inspired by Apache Spark & Scalding. This session will show some of the advantages of Scio, and how we combine it with Beam for performance and ease of development.
