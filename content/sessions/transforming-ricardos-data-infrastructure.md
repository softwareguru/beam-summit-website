The Data Intelligence Team at Ricardo, Switzerland's largest online marketplace, is a long-time Apache Beam user.
 
 Starting on-premise, we transitioned from running our own Apache Flink cluster on Kubernetes with over 40 streaming pipelines written in Apache Beam's Java SDK to Cloud Dataflow. This talk describes the obstacles and discusses our learnings along the way.
