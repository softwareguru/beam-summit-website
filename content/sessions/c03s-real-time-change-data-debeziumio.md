In this session, we will talk about DebeziumIO, which is a new transform that allows us to read change streams from various databases into Beam by relying on Debezium.

The great thing about DebeziumIO is that we can run the Debezium connector within our Beam Pipeline, without having to depend on Kafka for infrastructure.
