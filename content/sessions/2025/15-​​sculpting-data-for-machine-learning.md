While Generative AI models capture headlines, the foundation of any successful GenAI implementation remains quality data preparation at scale. Apache Beam provides the ideal framework for constructing robust data pipelines that can seamlessly process batch and streaming data for GenAI applications. This session will guide attendees through leveraging Beam's unified model to curate, transform, and deliver data ready for modern GenAI systems.

By combining Apache Beam with complementary technologies like Kafka for real-time streaming and Apache Iceberg for efficient data storage, we'll demonstrate how to build an end-to-end GenAI data ecosystem. Attendees will learn practical techniques for data extraction, transformation, and preparation specifically optimized for GenAI models, all while maintaining scalability and performance across diverse data sources.

This presentation will provide both theoretical frameworks and practical implementations for using Apache Beam to create scalable, efficient data pipelines specifically designed for GenAI applications. Attendees will leave with actionable knowledge on how to leverage Beam's unified processing model alongside technologies like Kafka and Iceberg to bridge diverse data streams into powerful GenAI solutions.
