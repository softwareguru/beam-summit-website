This presentation is designed for those new to Dataflow, offering a comprehensive introduction to building powerful data pipelines with ease. We will cover Beam YAML, a tool used for rapid development and it's advantages. We will walk through examples and demonstrate how you can use Cloud Shell editor to quickly get started. We will then transition from the foundational concepts to more advanced topics, including effective testing strategies, leveraging different providers, and integrating machine learning models. We will also cover Job Builder, a user-friendly interface that streamlines the creation of data movement and processing tasks and its relationship with Beam YAML; including features for exporting, importing, and directly editing YAML configurations. We will explore a variety of common data processing patterns, such as filtering, mapping, and executing SQL transformations, all while incorporating robust error-handling techniques to ensure your pipelines are resilient and reliable. Leave this session equipped to build, customize, and manage sophisticated data pipelines with newfound speed and simplicity with Dataflow.
