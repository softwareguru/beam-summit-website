Modern data architectures are no longer built around a single tool — they thrive on interoperability and community-driven integration. This session explores how Apache Beam serves as the flexible processing engine that connects streaming platforms like Kafka with modern, ACID-compliant data lakehouse solutions like Apache Iceberg.

Through real-world architecture patterns and practical examples, we’ll dive into how organizations are using Beam to unify disparate data sources, enable real-time and batch analytics, and future-proof their data platforms. You'll also gain insights into how the open-source community continues to drive innovation across this ecosystem — from new connectors to performance optimizations and beyond.

Whether you're designing pipelines, modernizing ETL, or exploring community-powered tooling, this session gives you the blueprint to build scalable, production-ready data ecosystems with confidence.
