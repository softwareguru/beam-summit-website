SDF and IO are tricky subjects, doubly so for SDF IO. This session dives deeper into the SDF read transform in KafkaIO and will highlight a few crucial performance issues that have been addressed in recent releases of Apache Beam. The session is aimed at IO contributors with the goal to emphasize the subtle nuances in SDF and IO code that can make or break performance.
