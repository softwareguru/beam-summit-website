Are your deployed Beam pipelines properly sized to meet your SLOs? Currently thereâ€™s no standard way of benchmarking your Dataflow pipelines to measure expected output rate or utilization, which are required for capacity planning and cost optimization. This talk is to present a methodology and a toolset to benchmark performance (event latency and throughput) of a custom Beam pipeline using Dataflow as runner. Results would be synthesized into prescriptive sizing guidelines to achieve best performance/cost ratio. Presented methodology can also be used to monitor and avoid pipeline performance regressions as part of your pipeline development and CI/CD process.
