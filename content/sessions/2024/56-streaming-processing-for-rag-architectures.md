The session is aimed to practitioners looking to use streaming technologies to process data which will be in use for near real time RAG architectures. 

For context, the session is based in this article: https://beam.apache.org/blog/dyi-content-discovery-platform-genai-beam

Agenda: 
- quick intro to RAG
- why streaming processing
