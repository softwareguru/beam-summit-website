This talk is for you if you are considering writing custom code to read from and write to a Web API, for which a solution does not yet exist. This session demonstrates step by step how to read from and write to Web APIs using the Beam Java and Python SDKs. 

Web API providers design the service for application workloads, presenting unique challenges for large scale parallelized workloads such as Beam. Challenges addressed will include error handling, retry with backoff, and caching.
