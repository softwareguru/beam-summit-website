This talk will explain some of the capabilities of Dataflow that can help users save costs:

1. Dynamic Thread Scaling: Dataflow tries to maximize the worker utilisation with this feature and avoids using up more workers.
2. Right fitting: Customize the resources at stage level and efficiently use the worker resources.
3. Streaming autoscaling: Tune autoscaling behavior to save costs.
