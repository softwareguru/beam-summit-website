The purpose of this session will be to introduce Beam YAML and its core capabilities. These include, but are not limited to:
- Basic syntax for declaring pipeline spec and pipeline options 
- Mapping transforms and UDF's 
- Simple aggregations 
- Other turnkey transforms (LogForTesting, IO's, etc.)

The session will wrap up with some use-case examples and how to run the YAML pipelines on Google Cloud Dataflow.
