We all know that the benchmarking is a very important but quite tough and ambiguous part of performance testing for every software system. Furthermore, benchmarking the systems that support different language SDKs and distributed data processing runtimes, like Apache Beam, is even more tough and ambiguous. 
 
In this talk we will discover what kind of benchmark frameworks Apache Beam already supports (Nexmark, TPC-DS), how they can be used for different purposes (like release testing) by developers and ordinary users, and what are the plans for the future work.
