When there is lot of telemetry coming in from thousands of devices, how to identify , in real time, when particular sensor has failed.

Architecture and demonstration using - Apache beam on Dataflow, Yugabyte and Grafana - to identify failed feed from industrial sensors in real time.



Demo scenario will have 200 sensors across - 5 factories , each factory with 6 sections and 6 different types of sensors.  it will illustrate not only failures but see how the sensor status changes back to active when put back into service.
