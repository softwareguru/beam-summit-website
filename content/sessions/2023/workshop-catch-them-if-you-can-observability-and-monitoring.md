A workshop with a live streaming Dataflow job, that has specific bugs and issues that we will address using Dataflow.

We'll begin by showing all the new (and existing) and revamped features that have been introduced in Dataflow.

The streaming job will be plagued with issues - even if the pipeline isn't failing, doesn't mean it's running well!
We'll use the features in Dataflow to capture some of these issues and correct them.

We'll also use Beam to capture some custom metrics and show where you can find them.
