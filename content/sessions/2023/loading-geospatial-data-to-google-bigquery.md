With decreasing costs for cloud computing and storage, numerous traditional Geographic Information System (GIS) workloads are being shifted to cloud-based platforms such as Google Cloud Platform (GCP). Consequently, there is a surge in the adoption of GCP for GIS-related tasks such as data ingestion, storage, and visualization.
 
During this session, we will provide an introduction to two of the most frequently utilized GIS data formats: Shapefile (shp) and Tag Image File Format (TIFF). We will also discuss the reasons and methods for loading these formats into Google BigQuery, including a serverless approach using geobeam for ingesting GIS files into BigQuery. Furthermore, we will offer some best practices and highlight things to avoid.
