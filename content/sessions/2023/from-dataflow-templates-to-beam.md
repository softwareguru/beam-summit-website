Chartboost has been using forms of Beam and Dataflow for years. We got started with dataflow templates. In this talk, we will share our perceived pros/cons as well as how and why we evolved into writing actual Beam. We share some of what we’ve been able to accomplish, and lessons learned throughout our journey.
