Jump on a stage and tell us about your latest big data efforts with Beam or otherwise.
The first session will be a call to action to build a Generative AI prompt repository for Beam.
Then, the rest of sessions will come from volunteers. Sign up with the organizers or sheets on the walls, or simply walk up to the stage!
