In this interactive session, we will aim to answer some questions about the future of the Apache Beam community. We will start with an overview of what was done in the past, how the community has grown, and find any pain points that we can work on and how to make the community sustainable, inviting and ready for future growth. 
 
 Bring both your most critical questions as well as your best ideas!
