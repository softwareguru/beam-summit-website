How can we improve a streaming application’s throughput by an order of magnitude? Today, the go-to strategy for handling larger volumes of events or reducing end-to-end latency is scaling out. However, throwing resources at the problem is like traveling in a hot air balloon: it’s expensive and it might not even get us to the destination. In this talk, I will introduce resource-conscious reconfiguration and show how knowledge about streaming workloads and their execution can improve application performance without requiring additional resources. I will share our latest research on resource-conscious optimizations for stream processing, such as workload-aware state management, task placement, and OS-tuning. Finally, I will discuss open challenges in making next-generation stream processing systems self-managed and resource-efficient.
