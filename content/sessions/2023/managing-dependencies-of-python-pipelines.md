In this talk we will discuss approaches to configure software dependencies of Apache Beam Python pipelines, how to avoid rough edges during pipeline submission, and how to debug issues pertaining to dependency management when they occur.
 
 
 
 We will also touch on lessons learned from managing dependencies of Apache Beam Python SDK itself.
