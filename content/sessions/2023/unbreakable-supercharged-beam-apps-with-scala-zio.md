Google Cloud Dataflow with Beam is at the core of how Credit Karma recommends the best offers for its 120M+ users worldwide. Using Scala with ZIO, we will demonstrate with code examples how to easily solve common production challenges including: 
 
 
 
 * controlling misbehaving Tensorflow & PMML models
 
 * transient job failures and Dataflow bugs, 
 
 * running multiple parallel jobs
 
 * detecting anomalous jobs
 
 * preventing errors at the petabyte scale
 
 * speculative jobs for optimizing operation
 
 * and more
