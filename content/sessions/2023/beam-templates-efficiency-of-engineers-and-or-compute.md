Chartboost has been using Beam templates to keep our Data Engineers developing pipelines efficiently. In this talk, we will share some of our experiences, and some of our recent learnings - especially around performance benchmarks, which were done to help us quantify the [ potential ] tradeoffs between developer and computational efficiency. We will share the concrete numbers and methods, so you can make your own decision.
