Since the inception of the open-source Apache Kafka project in 2011, the tech industry has hummed with excitement over the extraordinary possibilities of streaming data and real-time analytics. But while we’ve witnessed groundbreaking applications of these technologies, the widespread adoption we had hoped for over the past decade has failed to materialize.

In this talk, I will surface common pitfalls that prevent real-time data projects from realizing their full potential. In exploring solutions to these problems, I will introduce essential elements for constructing successful real-time analytics products. We’ll also discuss actionable steps that technical practitioners can take to bring about wider adoption of real-time data technology within their organizations and beyond.
