- Overview of hot keys and their impact on Beam pipelines
 
 - Techniques for hot key detection and handling, including key partitioning and key normalization
 
 - Best practices for dealing with hot keys in Beam pipelines, such as using custom combiners and windowing, and tuning pipeline settings 
 
 - Some examples of Dataflow pipelines where hot key detection and handling proved to be critical for successful pipeline execution.
 
 
 
 Attendees will leave this talk with a deeper understanding of how to identify and address hot key issues in their Beam pipelines, leading to better pipeline performance, scalability, and reliability.
