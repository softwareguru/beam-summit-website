Overview of a Beam IO development process and practical insights gained from experience developing CDAP IO and SparkReceiverIO.
 
 
 
 CDAP IO provides transforms for reading and writing data via CDAP (https://cdap.io/ ) plugins to connect Apache Beam with a variety of applications like Salesforce, Hubspot, ServiceNow, and Zendesk. Streaming SparkReceiver IO connector provides read transforms using Custom Spark Receivers, for example, to support streaming reading in CDAP IO.
