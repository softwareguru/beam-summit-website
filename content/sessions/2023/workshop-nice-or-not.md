In this workshop, we will be creating our pipeline using Beam to identify toxic behavior and action on it.

Gaming should be fun but too often, toxic behavior brings bad attitude and behavior that needs to be addressed.

We'll be reading in data and using a model to infer if the text is toxic or not in real time using Beam's RunInference module.

You'll be able to implement an ML pipeline using the skills you learn from this workshop.
