I have a background in data analytics/engineering, user privacy, database migration and data visualization. I am currently working as a Cloud Data Engineer with Google, based out of the San Francisco office, delivering technical data engineering solutions to Google's most strategic customers that move to Google Cloud. I have previously worked as Data Analyst in the personalized ads and user privacy space at Google. Outside work I enjoy outdoorsy things, travelling and have a keen interest in the stock market.
