I am a Software Engineer on the Data Platform team, where I focus on designing robust data pipelines, optimizing storage solutions, and ensuring secure, reliable data delivery across systems. At Box, I contribute to building scalable infrastructure that supports analytics, machine learning, and operational workloads. Prior to joining Box, I earned my Masterâ€™s degree in Computer Science, deepening my expertise in distributed systems and data engineering. Earlier in my career, I worked at Gigamon as a Software Engineer, developing diagnostic software atop network switches.
