I lead the Data Platform group at Transmit Security, where I am responsible for the entire data infrastructure. With over five years of experience at Microsoft, I played a pivotal role in building the real-time anomaly detection infrastructure using Apache Flink. My expertise lies in developing large-scale, real-time data processing systems designed to detect and prevent fraudulent activities.
