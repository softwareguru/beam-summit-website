Hey there! I'm Shubham Krishna, a Machine Learning Engineer at ML6. My days at ML6 are spent diving deep into cutting-edge technologies to solve complex problems with ease. Whether I'm building Dataflow and Vertex AI pipelines or working with Deep Learning models to tackle tasks like Name-Entity-Recognition and Image Segmentation, I'm always pushing the boundaries of what's possible. And when it comes to putting those models into production, I know exactly what it takes to make them shine.
