Iâ€™m a Machine Learning Engineer on the Shield Team at Box, focusing on developing cutting-edge security solutions. I spent the last six years at Google, working on different projects. I started in Google Cloud, building IAM Recommender. Then I moved to the Ads team and worked on spotting spam traffic on YouTube. Before Google, I used machine learning to improve efficiency at Samsung's manufacturing plants, and before that, I finished my PhD in building the theoretical foundation of anonymous communication. In my free time, I love getting outdoors, cooking, and playing chess.
