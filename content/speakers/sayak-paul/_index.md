Sayak is broadly interested in the area of representation learning. More specifically, he is interested in the following areas: semi-supervision, self-supervision, and model robustness. At Carted, he is currently working on our NLP-powered application that can extract attributes from all different product pages across the web. He enjoys implementing research ideas, sometimes incorporating them in practical applications, and communicating my implementation details through articles.
