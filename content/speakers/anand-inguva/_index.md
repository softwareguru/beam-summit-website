I am Anand. I am from India. I did my undergrad at IIIT Guwahati and Masters in Computer Engineering at NYU. I work at Google as a Software Engineer. I work on Beam Python and Dataflow ML. My goal is to provide users with simple set of transforms that covers ML use cases and improve user experience for large scale ML inference workloads.
