Peter Wagener has spent his career helping companies – from startups to established technology leaders – engineer software solutions that solve problems businesses and consumers didn’t even know they had. As CTO, he's led companies through hyper-growth phases, built engaged, high-performing teams from the ground up, and introduced tech innovation with massive revenue potential.

He has spent decades developing distributed, scalable systems. This includes: Patented data storage and systems management software for multi-million-dollar data centers; Payment systems processing billions of dollars per year; Data storage systems ingesting and scrubbing millions of entries per day; And data pipelines combining disparate data sources into new insights for clients across many industries.

Peter is passionate about event-driven systems, development tools, unit testing, and certainty in distributed systems design.  When not building solutions, he tends to snowboard, run long distances, and pass the time with his dog and family in Brooklyn.
