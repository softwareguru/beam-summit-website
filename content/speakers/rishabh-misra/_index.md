Author of the book "Sculpting Data for ML", I am a Lead ML Engineer & Researcher recognized by the US Government for outstanding contribution to ML research. I have extensively published and reviewed research at top AI conferences in NLP (LLMs / GenAI), Deep Learning, and Applied ML domains, such as ICML, KDD, ACL, TheWebConf, and RecSys, amassing over 800 citations. I specialize in designing low-latency, large-scale Deep Learning models and my work has received wide media coverage, notably by TechCrunch, Times of India, The Sun, Hindustan Times, Gizmodo, NBC, and Slash Film. My research work is also being used in Deeplearning.ai's "Natural Language Processing in TensorFlow" course, used as training material for Google's TensorFlow professional certification program, and used in an NSF-funded project, Narrative Modeling with StoryQ, to teach the concept of text classification models to high school students. The Data Science community has utilized my research artifacts hundreds of thousands of times to learn and apply ML concepts on leading platforms like Kaggle. Professionally, I am an ML Tech Lead of a foundational team driving 0 to 1 AI‑powered personalization efforts for Conversational Commerce (marketing relevant products through text/email) at a late-stage startup and have previously led AI-powered user personalization at Twitter and Amazon.
