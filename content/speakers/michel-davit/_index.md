Member of the RoaR (Royalties & Reporting) product area, responsible for transforming billions of daily streams into accurate royalty payments.

I work on the data pipelines, gathering information from all over the company (streams, subscriptions, content metadata, etc) to product efficient aggregated data, supporting the licensor and publisher royalty computation.

The pipelines are built with Spotyfy's framework: Scio, developped in scala, running on Google Cloud Platorm.
