I’m a technology evangelist for big data open source in eBay, from distributed crawl system, behavior data sessionization and bot detection with map reduce to spark as analyst development optimize platform for ETL, from storm lambda based application to beam event time based streaming system. I’m also hands on web dev from mvc to event sourcing, domain driven in my earlier career. I believe creative ideas come out from diversity, discussion and colorful life.
