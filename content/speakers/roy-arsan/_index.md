Roy Arsan is a Solutions Architect at Google. He works with customers and partners building & deploying solutions on Google Cloud Platform. He often finds himself working at the intersection of Data Analytics and Security to help customers migrate to the cloud while maintaining end-to-end visibility. When not in the cloud, you'll find Roy back on earth planting drought-tolerant landscapes - perfect for hot summers in Austin, TX - where he currently lives with his wife and three boys.
