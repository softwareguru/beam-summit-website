I am Nagaraja Tantry (Naga) based out of San Diego, California. I work as Principal Engineer at Intuit focussed on driving Observability. I have overall 15+ years of experience in Software Development. Tough problems motivate me and making a positive impact on others through my work gives me satisfaction . In my spare time, love to read books/listen podcats related to spirituality and I am a big cricket(sport) fan.
