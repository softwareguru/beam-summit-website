I’m an engineer on the Shield Team at Box, where I focus on building scalable, near real-time data engineering solutions to support advanced security and threat detection systems.  Before joining Box, I spent three years at Bank of America, developing batch processing systems for cross-valuation adjustment risk models.  My earlier experience includes consulting and research in the cryptocurrency space, as well as data engineering roles at a hedge fund.  I hold a Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. Outside of work, I enjoy playing racket sports, staying active, and diving into science fiction across books, film, and games.
