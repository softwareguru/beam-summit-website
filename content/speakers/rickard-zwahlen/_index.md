Rickard is a data engineer who likes to see large numbers go up or down. That's why he has spent the last five years working with instrumentation data in the data collection platform @ Spotify. When the data is behaving, he likes to relax with any type of game, any type of music, and books that make you feel warm and fuzzy.
