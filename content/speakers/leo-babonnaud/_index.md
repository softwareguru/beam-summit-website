After graduating from Essec with a specialization in Data Science and Machine learning, I joined Octo 2 years ago.
Passionate about applied mathematics and programming, I have carried out various data engineering missions as a developer.

The search for powerful tools for Data, allowing to address the current challenges of volume in data processing, led me naturally on the road of Apache Beam and Dataflow.
